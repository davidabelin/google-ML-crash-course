# ACCURACY IS TP + TN / TP + TN + FP + FN
#             = 1.0 WHEN THERE ARE NO FALSE NEGATIVES AND NO FALSE POSITIVES
#                   IE. ALL GUESSES ARE CORRECT
# PRECISION IS TP / TP + FP 
#             = 1.0 WHEN THERE ARE NO FALSE POSITIVES
#                   IE. ALL POSITIVE GUESSES ARE POSITIVE CASES
# RECALL IS TP / TP + FN 
#              = 1.0 WHEN THERE ARE NO FALSE NEGATIVES
#                    IE. ALL NEGATIVE GUESSES ARE NEGATIVE CASES
# AUC IS AREA UNDER TPR VS FPR = RECALL VS FPR
#       = 1.0 WHEN ALL GUESSES ARE CORRECT
